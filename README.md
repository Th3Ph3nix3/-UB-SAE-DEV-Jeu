# Command Line Games Project in C++

Welcome to my study project in C++! This project involves developing a series of classic games playable directly from the command line. Here are the included games:

1. **Tic-Tac-Toe**: The classic strategy game where two players compete on a 3x3 grid.
2. **Snake**: A game where you control a snake that grows by eating apples while avoiding obstacles.
3. **Price is Right**: Guess the correct price of an item to win.
4. **Blackjack**: A card game where the goal is to have a hand total closer to 21 than the dealer's, without exceeding 21.
5. **Hangman**: Guess a word letter by letter before the hangman drawing is completed.
6. **Rock Paper Scissors**: A hand game where each player chooses between rock, paper, or scissors.
